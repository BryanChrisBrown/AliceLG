## Background & Support
This addon was created for the use with the Looking Glass lightfield display. I am not associated with the Looking Glass Factory and devoloped this tool in my freetime because I love Blender and this new amazing display technology created by the Looking Glass Factory. 

If you like this addon and can afford it, I would be really grateful, if you would consider a donation. Thank you!
