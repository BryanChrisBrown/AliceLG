## REFACTORING OF ALICE
- handle quilt presets by pylio
- load and store user defined presets

- handle installation of pyLightIO and its dependencies from preference pane or
  install automatic on startup (?)

  => check: if 'pip install' to defined path, are dependencies also installed there?

- decide: move all panel / ui related things to an extra file 'ui.py' (?)

## BUGS / ENHANCEMENTS

None



## DOCUMENTATION
