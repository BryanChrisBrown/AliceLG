## REFACTORING OF ALICE

- handle installation of pyLightIO and its dependencies from preference pane or
  install automatic on startup (?)

  => check: if 'pip install' to defined path, are dependencies also installed there?

## BUGS / ENHANCEMENTS

- BUG: Shading & Overlay settings - the "CUSTOM" setting also changes the current viewport

## DOCUMENTATION

- document the custom preset functionality
- add the doc_url property to the add-on as soon as the documentation is ready
